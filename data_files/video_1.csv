"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,74.88,77.72, So let's make a random forest.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,77.72,81.6," Step one, create a bootstrap dataset."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,81.6,86.0, Imagine that these four samples are the entire dataset that we are going to build a tree

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,100.16,106.24, The important detail is that we're allowed to pick the same sample more than once.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,106.24,109.75999999999999, This is the first sample that we randomly select.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,109.76,114.08000000000001, So it's the first sample in our bootstrap dataset.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,114.08000000000001,119.0, This is the second randomly selected sample from the original dataset.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,119.0,123.04, So it's the second sample in our bootstrap dataset.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,123.04,126.4, Here's the third randomly selected sample.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,126.4,129.76, So here it is in the bootstrap dataset.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,129.76,133.68," Lastly, here's the fourth randomly selected sample."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,137.04,138.84, And here it is.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,138.84,144.12," Bam, we've created a bootstrap dataset."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,175.88000000000002,179.28000000000003, we randomly select two.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,179.28000000000003,188.12," In this case, we randomly selected good blood circulation and blocked arteries as candidates for the root node."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,188.20000000000002,196.08," Just for the sake of the example, assume that good blood circulation did the best job separating the samples."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,196.08,203.56," Since we used good blood circulation, I'm going to gray it out so that we focus on the remaining variables."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,203.56,208.24, Now we need to figure out how to split samples at this node.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,208.24,216.84," Just like for the root, we randomly select two variables as candidates instead of all three remaining columns."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,216.84,224.24," And we just build the tree as usual, but only considering a random subset of variables at each step."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,224.24,226.44, Double bound.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,226.44,237.04," We built a tree, one, using a bootstrap dataset, and two, only considering a random subset of variables at each step."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,237.04,240.76, Here's the tree we just made.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,240.84,244.0," Now, go back to step one and repeat."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,244.0,250.79999999999998, Make a new bootstrap dataset and build a tree considering a subset of variables at each step.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,250.79999999999998,256.64," Ideally, you do this hundreds of times, but we only have space to show six."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,256.64,258.88, But you get the idea.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,258.88,267.64, Using a bootstrap sample and considering only a subset of variables at each step results in a wide variety of trees.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,267.64,274.44, The variety is what makes random forests more effective than individual decision trees.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,274.44,275.68, Sweet.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,275.68,280.2," Now that we've created a random forest, how do we use it?"

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,284.03999999999996,286.91999999999996, We've got all the measurements.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,286.91999999999996,291.64, And now we want to know if they have heart disease or not.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,291.64,296.52, So we take the data and run it down the first tree that we made.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,296.52,299.85999999999996, Boo-bba-doo- OH.

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,302.0,305.02, The patient has heart disease.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,305.02,308.62, And we keep track of that here.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,308.62,312.64, Now we run the dataset down the second tree that we made.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,312.64,316.5," The second tree also says yes,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,316.5,319.84, and we keep track of that here.

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,324.48,328.28000000000003," After running the data down all of the trees in the random forest,"

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,332.08000000000004,335.68," In this case, yes, received the most votes,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,335.68,339.68, so we will conclude that this patient has heart disease.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,339.68,342.18, Bam.

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,353.78,360.28," OK, now we've seen how to create and use a random forest."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,360.28,363.58, How do we know if it's any good?

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,448.08,451.08," Since the label with the most votes wins,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,451.08,455.08, it is the label that we assign this Out of Bag sample.

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,462.08,468.08, We then do the same thing for all of the Out of Bag samples for all of the trees.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,468.08,473.08, This Out of Bag sample was also correctly labeled.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,473.08,478.08, This Out of Bag sample was incorrectly labeled.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,478.08,482.08," Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,487.08,493.08, by the proportion of Out of Bag samples that were correctly classified by the random forest.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,493.08,501.08, The proportion of Out of Bag samples that were incorrectly classified is the Out of Bag error.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,501.08,509.08," Okay, we now know how to 1 build a random forest, 2 use a random forest,"

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,515.08,518.08," However, now that we know how to do this,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,518.08,522.08, we can talk a little more about how to do this.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,522.08,528.08," Remember when we built our first tree, and we only use two variables, columns of data,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,528.08,531.08, to make a decision at each step.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,531.08,535.08," Now we can compare the Out of Bag error for a random forest,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,535.08,538.08," built using only two variables per step,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,538.08,543.08," to a random forest, built using three variables per step."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,544.08,550.08," And we test a bunch of different settings, and choose the most accurate random forest."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,550.08,554.08," In other words, 1, we build a random forest,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,554.08,558.08," and then 2, we estimate the accuracy of a random forest."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,558.08,562.08," Then we change the number of variables used per step,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,562.08,568.08," and we do this a bunch of times, and then choose the one that is the most accurate."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,568.08,572.08," Typically, we start by using the square of the number of variables,"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,572.08,577.08, and then try a few settings above and below that value.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,577.08,580.08, Triple ban.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,580.08,584.08," Hooray, we've made it to the end of another exciting stat quest."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,584.08,588.08," Tune in next week, and we'll talk about how to deal with missing data"
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,588.08,590.08, and how to cluster the samples.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,590.08,593.08," All right, until then, quest on."
