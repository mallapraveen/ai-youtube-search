StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,515.44,517.76, Now we have a 10 here and here.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,522.72,526.72, we see that the largest number in the proximity matrix is 1.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,528.0,533.2, 1 in the proximity matrix means the samples are as close as close can be.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,534.64,540.8, That means 1 minus the proximity values equals distance.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,609.52,615.36, Imagine we had already built a random forest with existing data and wanted to classify this new patient.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,620.64,622.96, But we don't know if they have blocked arteries.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,624.0,629.6, So we need to make a guess about blocked arteries so we can run the patient down all the trees in the forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,631.2,634.4, The first thing we do is create two copies of the data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,634.96,639.44, One that has heart disease and one that doesn't have heart disease.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,648.24,650.24, These are the guesses that we came up with.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,674.8,679.04, This option wins because it was correctly labeled more than the other option.
