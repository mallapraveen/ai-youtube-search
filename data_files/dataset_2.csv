StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,102.24,106.52, So no is our initial guess.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,106.56,108.52, This weight is numeric.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,108.52,114.92, Our initial guess will be the median value of the patients that did not have heart disease.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,130.16,136.48, We do this by first determining which samples are similar to the one with missing data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,136.51999999999998,140.72, So let's talk about how to determine similarity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,140.72,141.72, Step 1.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,164.2,171.04, Notice that sample 3 and sample 4 both ended up at the same leaf node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,171.04,178.0," That means they're similar, at least that cell similarity is defined in random forests."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,178.0,182.72, We keep track of similar samples using a proximity matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,182.72,191.32," The proximity matrix has a row for each sample, and it has a column for each sample."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,191.32,200.0," Because sample 3 and sample 4 ended up in the same leaf node, we put a 1 here."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,236.92,242.68, This is what the proximity matrix looked like after running the data down the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,242.68,249.48," And after the second tree, we add 1 to any pair of samples that ended up in the same leaf node."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,258.64,262.64, Now we run all of the data down the third tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,262.64,266.8, And here's the updated proximity matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,266.8,271.8, Only samples 3 and 4 ended up in the same leaf node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,271.8,278.52," Ultimately, we run the data down all the trees and the proximity matrix fills in."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,278.64,282.76, Then we divide each proximity value by the total number of trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,282.76,287.03999999999996," In this example, assume we had 10 trees."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,329.08,336.56," The proximity for yes is the proximity value for sample 2, the only one with yes."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,336.68,343.8, And we divide that by the sum of the proximity for sample 4.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,343.8,347.96, So the weight for yes is 0.1.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,347.96,353.6," Thus, the weighted frequency for yes is 0.03."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,379.28,384.12, And the weighted frequency for no is 0.6.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,384.12,389.52," No has a way higher weighted frequency, so we'll go with it."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,389.52,398.52," In other words, our new improved and revised guests based on the proximity is no for blocked arteries."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,528.12,534.72, 1 in the proximity matrix means the samples are as close as close can be.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,534.72,542.4000000000001, That means 1 minus the proximity values equals distance.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,542.48,554.48, Closes can be equals no distance between and not close equals far away.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,554.48,560.72, This is a distance matrix and that means we can draw heat map with it.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,560.72,565.76," If you don't know what a heat map is, check out the stat quest."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,565.76,569.6, And we can also draw an MDS plot with it.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,575.28,583.52," I think this is super cool because it means that no matter what the data are, ranks, multiple choice, numeric, etc."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,583.52,590.88," If we can use it to make a tree, we can draw heat map or an MDS plot to show how the samples are related to each other."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,590.88,592.96, This is awesome.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,592.96,595.96," Dremble, bam."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,595.96,598.12," Okay, enough fun stuff."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,598.12,601.08, Let's get back to the missing data problem.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,601.08,604.0400000000001," At long last, we'll talk about the second method."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,604.0400000000001,609.64, This is when we have missing data in a new sample that we want to categorize.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,609.64,616.9200000000001, Imagine we had already built a random forest with existing data and wanted to classify this new patient.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,616.9200000000001,620.6800000000001, So we want to know if they have heart disease or not.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,620.6800000000001,624.12, But we don't know if they have blocked arteries.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,624.12,631.24, So we need to make a guess about blocked arteries so we can run the patient down all the trees in the forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,631.24,635.0, The first thing we do is create two copies of the data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,635.0,640.84, One that has heart disease and one that doesn't have heart disease.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,640.84,647.64, Then we use the iterative method we just talked about to make a good guess about the missing values.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,648.36,652.12, These are the guesses that we came up with.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,652.12,656.2, Then we run the two samples down the trees in the forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,656.2,661.32, And we see which of the two is correctly labeled by the random forest the most times.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,663.08,667.24, This option was correctly labeled yes in all three trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,668.92,672.92, This option was only correctly labeled no in one tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,674.76,679.08, This option wins because it was correctly labeled more than the other option.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,680.0400000000001,681.32, Bam.
