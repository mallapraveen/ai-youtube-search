StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,48.72,51.96, We'll start with this one.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,51.96,56.08, So we want to create a random forest from this data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,56.08,61.839999999999996," However, we don't know if this patient has blocked arteries or their weight."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,98.44,102.24, It occurs in two out of two samples.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,102.24,106.52, So no is our initial guess.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,106.56,108.52, This weight is numeric.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,108.52,114.92, Our initial guess will be the median value of the patients that did not have heart disease.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,114.92,121.52," In this case, the median value is 167.5."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,126.39999999999999,130.16, Now we want to refine these guesses.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,130.16,136.48, We do this by first determining which samples are similar to the one with missing data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,136.56,140.6, So let's talk about how to determine similarity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,140.6,141.82, Step 1.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,141.82,145.83999999999997, Build a random forest.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,147.06,151.06, Run all of the data down all of the trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,151.06,155.32, We'll start by running all of the data down the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,155.54,159.85999999999999, Do we do we do we do we do we do we do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,163.82,171.28, Notice the sample three and sample four both ended up at the same leap node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,171.28,172.56, That means they're similar.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,172.56,177.98, At least that's similarity is defined in random forests.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,177.98,182.78, We keep track of similar samples using a proximity matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,182.78,191.34, The proximity matrix has a row for each sample and it has a column for each sample.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,191.34,200.02, Because sample three and sample four ended up in the same leaf node we put a one here.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,200.02,206.78, We also put a one here since this position also represents samples three and four.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,206.78,212.14, Because no other pair of samples ended in the same leaf node our proximity matrix looks
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,212.14,217.1, like this after running the samples down the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,217.1,228.45999999999998, Now we run all of the data down the second tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,228.45999999999998,237.06, Note samples two three and four all ended up in the same leaf node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,237.1,242.82, This is what the proximity matrix looked like after running the data down the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,242.82,249.62, And after the second tree we add one to any pair of samples that ended up in the same leaf node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,249.62,254.58, Samples three and four ended up in the same node together again.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,254.58,258.9, And sample two also ended up in that same node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,258.9,262.86, Now we run all of the data down the third tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,262.86,267.02, And here's the updated proximity matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,267.02,271.97999999999996, Only samples three and four ended up in the same leaf node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,271.97999999999996,278.7, Ultimately we run the data down all the trees and the proximity matrix fills in.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,278.7,282.94, Then we divide each proximity value by the total number of trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,282.94,287.26, In this example assume we had ten trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,287.26,294.85999999999996, Now we use the proximity values for sample four to make better guesses about the missing data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,294.86,303.58000000000004, For blocked arteries we calculate the weighted frequency of yes and no using proximity values as the weight.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,303.58000000000004,308.22, Yes occurs in one third of the samples.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,308.22,312.54, No occurs in two thirds of the samples.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,312.54,322.06, The weighted frequency for yes is the frequency of yes times the weight for yes.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,322.06,329.18, The weight for yes equals the proximity of yes divided by all of the proximity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,329.18,333.58, The proximity for yes is the proximity value for sample two.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,333.58,336.62, The only one with yes.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,336.62,343.82, And we divide that by the sum of the proximity for sample four.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,343.82,347.98, So the weight for yes is 0.1.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,348.06,353.5, Thus the weighted frequency for yes is 0.03.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,353.5,360.06, The weighted frequency for no is the frequency of no which is two thirds.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,361.34000000000003,362.94, Times the weight for no.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,364.06,366.38, Samples one and three both have no.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,367.42,372.54, With that in mind we can plug in the values for the proximity of no divided by all
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,372.54,373.42, proximity.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,379.18,382.46000000000004, And the weighted frequency for no is 0.6.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,384.14000000000004,388.22, No has a way higher weighted frequency so we'll go with it.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,389.42,396.78000000000003, In other words our new improved and revised guests based on the proximity is no for blocked arteries.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,397.34,402.61999999999995, For weight we use the proximity to calculate a weighted average.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,403.97999999999996,409.58, In this case the weighted average equals sample one's weight.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,411.17999999999995,413.41999999999996, Sample one's weighted average weight.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,448.29999999999995,453.97999999999996, Ultimately the weighted average of weight is 198.5.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,453.98,459.1, And remember the weights that we used in the weighted average were based on proximity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,460.62,465.5, Now that we've revised our guesses a little bit we do the whole thing over again.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,476.3,480.3, We do this six or seven times until the missing values converge.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,480.38,483.74, IE no longer change each time we recalculate.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,515.42,517.74, Now we have a 10 here and here.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,519.18,525.42, After dividing by 10 the number of trees in the forest we see that the largest number in the proximity

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,528.06,533.26, 1 in the proximity matrix means the samples are as close as close can be.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,534.7,540.86, That means 1 minus the proximity values equals distance.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,542.38,552.7, Closes can be equals no distance between and not close equals far away.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,554.38,559.82, This is a distance matrix and that means we can draw heat map with it.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,560.62,563.98, If you don't know what a heat map is check out the stat quest.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,589.5,590.7, related to each other.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,590.7,591.5, This is awesome.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,595.9,597.98," Okay, enough fun stuff."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,597.98,599.98, Let's get back to the missing data problem.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,601.02,603.74, At long last we'll talk about the second method.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,603.74,608.14, This is when we have missing data in a new sample that we want to categorize.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,609.58,615.34, Imagine we had already built a random forest with existing data and wanted to classify this new patient.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,615.74,619.5, So we want to know if they have heart disease or not.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,620.5400000000001,622.94, But we don't know if they have blocked arteries.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,623.98,629.58, So we need to make a guess about blocked arteries so we can run the patient down all the trees in the forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,631.1800000000001,634.38, The first thing we do is create two copies of the data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,634.94,639.5, One that has heart disease and one that doesn't have heart disease.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,640.46,646.46, Then we use the iterative method we just talked about to make a good guess about the missing values.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,648.22,650.22, These are the guesses that we came up with.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,651.9,654.94, Then we run the two samples down the trees in the forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,656.14,661.26, And we see which of the two is correctly labeled by the random forest the most times.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,662.94,667.26, This option was correctly labeled yes in all three trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,667.74,672.9399999999999, This option was only correctly labeled no in one tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,674.78,679.02, This option wins because it was correctly labeled more than the other option.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,680.46,684.9399999999999, Bam we filled in the missing data and we've classified our sample.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,686.86,691.1, Hey we've made it to the end of another exciting stat quest.
