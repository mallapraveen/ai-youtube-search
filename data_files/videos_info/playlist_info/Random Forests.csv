Hello, I'm Josh Starmer and welcome to stat quest. Today we're going to be starting part one of a series on random forests, and we're going to talk about building and evaluating random forests. Note, random forests are built from decision trees, so if you don't already know about"

Decision trees are easy to build, easy to use, and easy to interpret. But in practice, they are not that awesome. To quote from the elements of statistical learning, aka the Bible of Machine Learning, trees have one aspect that prevents them from being the ideal tool for predictive learning, namely"

In other words, they work great with the data used to create them, but they are not flexible when it comes to classifying new samples. The good news is that random forests combine the simplicity of decision trees with flexibility resulting in a vast improvement in accuracy."

Step one, create a bootstrap dataset. Imagine that these four samples are the entire dataset that we are going to build a tree from. I know it's crazy small, but just pretend for now."

The important detail is that we're allowed to pick the same sample more than once. This is the first sample that we randomly select. So it's the first sample in our bootstrap dataset."

And here it is. Bam, we've created a bootstrap dataset. Step two for creating a random forest is to create a decision tree using the bootstrap dataset, but only use a random subset of variables or columns at each step."

Note, we'll talk more about how to determine the optimal number of variables to consider later. Thus, instead of considering all four variables to figure out how to split the root node, we randomly select two. In this case, we randomly selected good blood circulation and blocked arteries as candidates for the root node."

Since we used good blood circulation, I'm going to gray it out so that we focus on the remaining variables. Now we need to figure out how to split samples at this node. Just like for the root, we randomly select two variables as candidates instead of all three remaining columns. And we just build the tree as usual, but only considering a random subset of variables at each step."

This option was only correctly labeled no in one tree. This option wins because it was correctly labeled more than the other option. Bam we filled in the missing data and we've classified our sample. Hey we've made it to the end of another exciting stat quest.

55,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,0.0,28.0,28.0," You don't need a ukulele to do statistics, but it makes it more fun. Hello, I'm Josh Starmer and welcome to Stack Quest. Today we're going to talk about how to build, use and evaluate random forests in R. This stack quest builds on two stack quests that I've already created that demonstrate the theory behind random forests. So if you're not familiar with it, check them out."
56,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,28.0,60.0,32.0," Just so you know, you can download all the code that I described in this tutorial using the link in the description below. The first thing we do is load in GGplot 2 so we can draw fancy graphs. And when I do that, our prints out a little message, it's no big deal. Then we load CalPlot which just improves some of GGplot 2's default settings. It overrides the GG save function and that's fine with me, so no worries here."
57,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,60.0,85.0,25.0," The last library we need to load is random forest. So we can make random forests. It also prints out some stuff in red, but it's no big deal we can move on from here. For this example, we're going to get a real data set from the UCI machine learning repository. Specifically, we want the heart disease data set."
58,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,85.0,108.0,23.0," So we make a variable called URL and set it to the location of the data we want for our random forest. And this is how we read the data set into R from the URL. The head function shows us the first six rows of data. Unfortunately, none of the columns are labeled. Wow, wow."
59,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,108.0,128.0,20.0," So we name the columns after the names that were listed on the UCI website. The UCI website actually lists a whole lot of information about this data. So it's worth checking out if you haven't done that already. Hey. Now when we look at the first six rows with the head function, things look a lot better."
60,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,129.0,169.0,40.0," However, the stir function, which describes the structure of the data, tells us that some of the columns are messed up. Sex is supposed to be a factor where zero represents female and one represents male. CP, aka chest pain, is also supposed to be a factor where levels one through three represent different types of pain and four represents no chest pain. CA and thaw are correctly called factors, but one of the levels is question mark when we need it to be an NA. So we've got some cleaning up to do."
61,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,169.0,196.0,27.0," The first thing we do is change the question marks to NA's. Then, just to make the data easier on the eyes, we convert the zeros in sex to F for female. And the ones to M for male. Lastly, we convert the column into a factor. Then we convert a bunch of other columns into factors since that's what they're supposed to be."
62,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,196.0,223.0,27.0," See the UCI website or the sample code on the stat quest blog for more details. Since the CA column originally had a question mark in it, rather than NA, our thinks it's a column of strings. We correct that assumption by telling our it's a column of integers. And then we convert it to a factor. Then we do the exact same thing for thaw."
63,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,223.0,259.0,36.0," The last thing we need to do to the data is make HD aka heart disease, a factor that is easy on the eyes. Here I'm using a fancy trick with if else to convert the zeros to healthy and the ones to unhealthy. We could have done a similar trick for sex, but I wanted to show you both ways to convert numbers towards. Once we're done fixing up the data, we can check that we've made the appropriate changes with the stir function. Sex is now a factor with levels F and M."
64,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,259.0,289.0,30.0," And everything else looks good too. Hey, we're done with the boring part. Now we can have some fun. Since we're going to be randomly sampling things, let's set the seed for the random number generator so that we can reproduce our results. Now we impute values for the NA's and the data set with RF impute. The first argument to RF impute is HD tilde dot."
65,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,289.0,327.0,38.0," And that means we want the HD aka heart disease column to be predicted by the data in all of the other columns. Here's where we specify which data set to use. In this case, there's only one data set and it's called data. Here's where we specify how many random forests RF impute should build to estimate the missing values. In theory, 4 to 6 iterations is enough. Just for fun, I set this parameter, itter equal to 20, but it didn't improve the estimates."
66,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,328.0,372.0,44.0," Lastly, we save the results. The data set with imputed values instead of NA's as data dot imputed. After each iteration, RF impute prints out the out of bag, OOB, error rate. This should get smaller if the estimates are improving. Since it doesn't, we can conclude that our estimates are as good as they're going to get with this method. Here's where we actually build a proper random forest using the random forest function. Just like when we imputed values for the NA's, we want to predict HD aka heart disease using all of the other columns in the data set."
67,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,372.0,407.0,35.0," However, this time we specify data dot imputed as the data set. We also want random forest to return the proximity matrix, who will use this to cluster the samples at the end of the stat quest. Lastly, we save the random forest and associated data like the proximity matrix as model. To get a summary of the random forest and how well it performed, we can just type model on the command prompt and then hit enter. Here's what gets printed to the screen."
68,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,408.0,441.0,33.0," The first thing is the original call to random forest. Next, we see that the random forest was built to classify samples. If we had used the random forest to predict weight or height, it would say regression. And if we had omitted the thing, the random forest was supposed to predict entirely, it would say unsupervised. Then it tells us how many trees are in the random forest. The default value is 500."
69,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,441.0,474.0,33.0," Later, we will check to see if 500 trees is enough for optimal classification. Then it tells us how many variables or columns of data were considered at each internal node. Classification trees have a default setting of the square root of the number of variables. Regression trees have a default setting of the number of variables divided by 3. Since we don't know if 3 is the best value, we'll fiddle with this parameter later on."
70,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,474.0,509.0,35.0," Here's the out of bag, OOB, error estimate. This means that 83.5% of the OOB samples were correctly classified by the random forest. Lastly, we have a confusion matrix. There were 141 healthy patients that were correctly labeled healthy. Prey, there were 27 unhealthy patients that were incorrectly classified as healthy."
71,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,509.0,548.0,39.0," There were 23 healthy patients that were incorrectly classified on healthy. Lastly, there were 112 unhealthy patients that were correctly classified on healthy. Prey, to see if 500 trees is enough for optimal classification, we can plot the error rates. Here, we created data frame that formats the error rate information so that GG plot 2 will be happy. This is kind of complicated, so let me walk you through it."
72,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,548.0,586.0,38.0," For the most part, this is all based on a matrix within model called ER.rate. This is what the ER.rate matrix looks like. There's one column for the out of bag error rate. One column for the healthy error rate, i.e. how frequently healthy patients are misclassified. Each row reflects the error rates at different stages of creating the random forest."
73,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,586.0,614.0,28.0, The first row contains the error rates after making the first tree. The second row contains the error rates after making the first two trees. The last row contains the error rates after making all 500 trees. So what we're doing here is making a data frame that looks like this. There's one column for the number of trees.
74,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,614.0,634.0,20.0, There's one column for the type of error. And one column for the actual error value. And here's the call to GG plot. Bam. The blue line shows the error rate when classifying unhealthy patients.
75,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,634.0,661.0,27.0," The green line shows the overall out of bag error rate. The red line shows the error rate when classifying healthy patients. In general, we see the error rates decrease when our random forest has more trees. If we added more trees with the error rate go down further. To test this hypothesis, we make a random forest with 1000 trees."
76,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,661.0,686.0,25.0, The out of bag error rate is the same as before. And the confusion matrix shows that we didn't do a better job classifying patients. And we can plot the error rates just like before. Double bam. And we see that the error rates stabilize right after 500 trees.
77,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,686.0,716.0,30.0," So adding more trees didn't help, but we would not have known this unless we used more trees. Now we need to make sure we are considering the optimal number of variables at each internal node in the tree. We start by making an empty vector that can hold 10 values. And then we create a loop that tests different numbers of variables at each step. Each time we go through the loop, I increase by 1."
78,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,716.0,748.0,32.0," It starts at 1 and ends after 10. In this line, we are building a random forest using I to determine the number of variables to try at each step. Specifically, we are setting Mtri equals I and I equals values between 1 and 10. This is where we store the out of bag error rate after we build each random forest that uses a different value for Mtri. This is a bit of complex code."
79,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,748.0,774.0,26.0," Here's what's going on. Temp.model contains a matrix called Er.rate, just like model did before. And we want to access the value in the last row and in the first column. Ie, the out of bag error rate when all 1000 trees have been made. Now we can print out the out of bag error rates for different values for Mtri."
80,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,774.0,805.0,31.0," The third value corresponding to Mtri equals 3, which is the default in this case, has the lowest out of bag error rate. So the default value was optimal, but we wouldn't have known that unless we tried other values. Lastly, we want to use the random forest to draw an Mds plot with samples. This will show us how they are related to each other. If you don't know what an Mds plot is, don't freak out, just check out the stack quest on."
81,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,805.0,835.0,30.0," We start by using the dist function to make a distance matrix from 1 minus the proximity matrix. Then we run CMD scale on the distance matrix. CMD scale stands for classical multi-dimensional scaling. Then we calculate the percentage of variation in the distance matrix that the X and Y axes account for. Again, see the other stack quest for details."
82,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,835.0,854.0,19.0, Then we format the data for Gg plot. And then we draw the graph with Gg plot. Triple BAM. Unhealthy samples are on the left side. Healthy samples are on the right side.
83,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,854.0,887.0,33.0," I wonder if patient 253 was misdiagnosed, and actually has heart disease. Note, the X axis accounts for 47% of the variation in the distance matrix. The Y axis only accounts for 14% of the variation in the distance matrix. That means that the big differences are along the X axis. Lastly, if we got a new patient and didn't know if they had heart disease and they clustered down here,"
84,StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,887.0,909.0,22.0," we'd be pretty confident that they had heart disease. Her A, we've made it to the end of another exciting stack quest. If you like this stack quest and want to see more of them, please subscribe.
