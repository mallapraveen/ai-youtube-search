0,0,What Is Generative AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m7Pgl-84F8,2m7Pgl-84F8,0.0,20.2,20.2, Hello all my name is Krishnak and welcome to my U-Dish channel.

4,4,What Is Generative AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m7Pgl-84F8,2m7Pgl-84F8,83.44,102.56,19.120000000000005, I really want to discuss where does generative AI falls into picture whether it is a part of deep learning where does it fall in deep learning what is the differences between the deep learning models that we learned in CNN.

right so this is basically a kind of prediction classification right this is called as a discriminative technique over here obviously I can use RNN I can use LSTM RNN I can use different kind of techniques over here right to do the prediction but if I talk about generative technique in generative I will give the music right I'll be probably training my generative model with different

data it is generating new data in short right so this was what is generative techniques again let's see one content over here how the training process works I will be having a unstructured content

generative image models even that option is also there right so how machine learning is involved in now initially in machine learning in deep learning or let's say in a n we usually had features we have independent features we have output feature right my model used to see how is the relationship between this independent and the output features and based on that the prediction was done then came

then you will be able to give the own answer that is how this kind of generative AI language models are basically trained specifically I'm talking about generative language models there will be

35,35,What Is Generative AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m7Pgl-84F8,2m7Pgl-84F8,908.24,935.52,27.279999999999973, from an LLM model is all dependent on this prompt engineering work and again I'll be creating a series of tutorial with respect to prompt engineering where we'll be using open AI API itself right so I hope you like this particular video I hope you got an idea with respect to generative AI because there are lot many things that are going to come up with respect to this in the next video I'm going to discuss about LLM models as I always suggested I always try to take it
