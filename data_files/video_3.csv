StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,0.0,10.0," You don't need a ukulele to do statistics, but it makes it more fun."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,10.0,13.0," Hello, I'm Josh Starmer and welcome to Stack Quest."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,13.0,19.0," Today we're going to talk about how to build, use and evaluate random forests in R."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,19.0,25.0, This stack quest builds on two stack quests that I've already created that demonstrate the theory behind random forests.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,25.0,28.0," So if you're not familiar with it, check them out."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,28.0,36.0," Just so you know, you can download all the code that I described in this tutorial using the link in the description below."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,36.0,42.0, The first thing we do is load in GGplot 2 so we can draw fancy graphs.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,42.0,47.0," And when I do that, our prints out a little message, it's no big deal."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,48.0,55.0, Then we load CalPlot which just improves some of GGplot 2's default settings.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,55.0,60.0," It overrides the GG save function and that's fine with me, so no worries here."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,60.0,65.0, The last library we need to load is random forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,65.0,68.0, So we can make random forests.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,68.0,74.0," It also prints out some stuff in red, but it's no big deal we can move on from here."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,75.0,81.0," For this example, we're going to get a real data set from the UCI machine learning repository."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,81.0,85.0," Specifically, we want the heart disease data set."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,85.0,93.0, So we make a variable called URL and set it to the location of the data we want for our random forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,93.0,98.0, And this is how we read the data set into R from the URL.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,98.0,102.0, The head function shows us the first six rows of data.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,103.0,106.0," Unfortunately, none of the columns are labeled."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,106.0,108.0," Wow, wow."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,108.0,113.0, So we name the columns after the names that were listed on the UCI website.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,113.0,118.0, The UCI website actually lists a whole lot of information about this data.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,118.0,121.0, So it's worth checking out if you haven't done that already.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,121.0,122.0, Hey.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,122.0,128.0," Now when we look at the first six rows with the head function, things look a lot better."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,129.0,137.0," However, the stir function, which describes the structure of the data, tells us that some of the columns are messed up."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,137.0,144.0, Sex is supposed to be a factor where zero represents female and one represents male.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,144.0,156.0," CP, aka chest pain, is also supposed to be a factor where levels one through three represent different types of pain and four represents no chest pain."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,157.0,165.0," CA and thaw are correctly called factors, but one of the levels is question mark when we need it to be an NA."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,165.0,169.0, So we've got some cleaning up to do.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,169.0,174.0, The first thing we do is change the question marks to NA's.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,174.0,181.0," Then, just to make the data easier on the eyes, we convert the zeros in sex to F for female."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,182.0,185.0, And the ones to M for male.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,186.0,190.0," Lastly, we convert the column into a factor."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,190.0,196.0, Then we convert a bunch of other columns into factors since that's what they're supposed to be.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,196.0,203.0, See the UCI website or the sample code on the stat quest blog for more details.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,204.0,211.0," Since the CA column originally had a question mark in it, rather than NA, our thinks it's a column of strings."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,211.0,216.0, We correct that assumption by telling our it's a column of integers.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,216.0,219.0, And then we convert it to a factor.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,219.0,223.0, Then we do the exact same thing for thaw.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,223.0,231.0," The last thing we need to do to the data is make HD aka heart disease, a factor that is easy on the eyes."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,232.0,239.0, Here I'm using a fancy trick with if else to convert the zeros to healthy and the ones to unhealthy.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,239.0,247.0," We could have done a similar trick for sex, but I wanted to show you both ways to convert numbers towards."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,247.0,254.0," Once we're done fixing up the data, we can check that we've made the appropriate changes with the stir function."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,254.0,259.0, Sex is now a factor with levels F and M.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,259.0,262.0, And everything else looks good too.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,262.0,268.0," Hey, we're done with the boring part. Now we can have some fun."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,268.0,277.0," Since we're going to be randomly sampling things, let's set the seed for the random number generator so that we can reproduce our results."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,277.0,283.0, Now we impute values for the NA's and the data set with RF impute.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,284.0,289.0, The first argument to RF impute is HD tilde dot.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,289.0,299.0, And that means we want the HD aka heart disease column to be predicted by the data in all of the other columns.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,299.0,307.0," Here's where we specify which data set to use. In this case, there's only one data set and it's called data."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,307.0,315.0, Here's where we specify how many random forests RF impute should build to estimate the missing values.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,315.0,319.0," In theory, 4 to 6 iterations is enough."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,319.0,327.0," Just for fun, I set this parameter, itter equal to 20, but it didn't improve the estimates."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,328.0,337.0," Lastly, we save the results. The data set with imputed values instead of NA's as data dot imputed."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,337.0,345.0," After each iteration, RF impute prints out the out of bag, OOB, error rate."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,345.0,355.0," This should get smaller if the estimates are improving. Since it doesn't, we can conclude that our estimates are as good as they're going to get with this method."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,355.0,361.0, Here's where we actually build a proper random forest using the random forest function.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,361.0,372.0," Just like when we imputed values for the NA's, we want to predict HD aka heart disease using all of the other columns in the data set."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,372.0,378.0," However, this time we specify data dot imputed as the data set."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,379.0,387.0," We also want random forest to return the proximity matrix, who will use this to cluster the samples at the end of the stat quest."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,387.0,395.0," Lastly, we save the random forest and associated data like the proximity matrix as model."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,395.0,404.0," To get a summary of the random forest and how well it performed, we can just type model on the command prompt and then hit enter."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,404.0,407.0, Here's what gets printed to the screen.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,408.0,412.0, The first thing is the original call to random forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,412.0,418.0," Next, we see that the random forest was built to classify samples."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,418.0,425.0," If we had used the random forest to predict weight or height, it would say regression."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,425.0,433.0," And if we had omitted the thing, the random forest was supposed to predict entirely, it would say unsupervised."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,434.0,441.0, Then it tells us how many trees are in the random forest. The default value is 500.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,441.0,448.0," Later, we will check to see if 500 trees is enough for optimal classification."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,448.0,455.0, Then it tells us how many variables or columns of data were considered at each internal node.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,455.0,462.0, Classification trees have a default setting of the square root of the number of variables.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,462.0,468.0, Regression trees have a default setting of the number of variables divided by 3.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,468.0,474.0," Since we don't know if 3 is the best value, we'll fiddle with this parameter later on."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,474.0,479.0," Here's the out of bag, OOB, error estimate."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,479.0,487.0, This means that 83.5% of the OOB samples were correctly classified by the random forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,487.0,491.0," Lastly, we have a confusion matrix."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,492.0,497.0, There were 141 healthy patients that were correctly labeled healthy.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,497.0,509.0," Prey, there were 27 unhealthy patients that were incorrectly classified as healthy."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,509.0,517.0, There were 23 healthy patients that were incorrectly classified on healthy.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,517.0,524.0," Lastly, there were 112 unhealthy patients that were correctly classified on healthy."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,524.0,535.0," Prey, to see if 500 trees is enough for optimal classification, we can plot the error rates."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,535.0,543.0," Here, we created data frame that formats the error rate information so that GG plot 2 will be happy."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,544.0,548.0," This is kind of complicated, so let me walk you through it."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,548.0,555.0," For the most part, this is all based on a matrix within model called ER.rate."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,555.0,560.0, This is what the ER.rate matrix looks like.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,560.0,564.0, There's one column for the out of bag error rate.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,564.0,572.0," One column for the healthy error rate, i.e. how frequently healthy patients are misclassified."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,572.0,586.0, Each row reflects the error rates at different stages of creating the random forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,586.0,592.0, The first row contains the error rates after making the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,592.0,598.0, The second row contains the error rates after making the first two trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,598.0,604.0, The last row contains the error rates after making all 500 trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,604.0,610.0, So what we're doing here is making a data frame that looks like this.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,610.0,614.0, There's one column for the number of trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,614.0,617.0, There's one column for the type of error.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,617.0,622.0, And one column for the actual error value.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,622.0,625.0, And here's the call to GG plot.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,626.0,628.0, Bam.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,628.0,634.0, The blue line shows the error rate when classifying unhealthy patients.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,634.0,639.0, The green line shows the overall out of bag error rate.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,639.0,644.0, The red line shows the error rate when classifying healthy patients.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,644.0,651.0," In general, we see the error rates decrease when our random forest has more trees."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,652.0,656.0, If we added more trees with the error rate go down further.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,656.0,661.0," To test this hypothesis, we make a random forest with 1000 trees."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,661.0,666.0, The out of bag error rate is the same as before.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,666.0,672.0, And the confusion matrix shows that we didn't do a better job classifying patients.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,672.0,677.0, And we can plot the error rates just like before.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,677.0,680.0, Double bam.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,680.0,686.0, And we see that the error rates stabilize right after 500 trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,686.0,693.0," So adding more trees didn't help, but we would not have known this unless we used more trees."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,693.0,701.0, Now we need to make sure we are considering the optimal number of variables at each internal node in the tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,701.0,706.0, We start by making an empty vector that can hold 10 values.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,707.0,712.0, And then we create a loop that tests different numbers of variables at each step.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,712.0,716.0," Each time we go through the loop, I increase by 1."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,716.0,720.0, It starts at 1 and ends after 10.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,720.0,728.0," In this line, we are building a random forest using I to determine the number of variables to try at each step."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,728.0,735.0," Specifically, we are setting Mtri equals I and I equals values between 1 and 10."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,736.0,745.0, This is where we store the out of bag error rate after we build each random forest that uses a different value for Mtri.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,745.0,748.0, This is a bit of complex code.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,748.0,750.0, Here's what's going on.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,750.0,757.0," Temp.model contains a matrix called Er.rate, just like model did before."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,757.0,762.0, And we want to access the value in the last row and in the first column.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,762.0,768.0," Ie, the out of bag error rate when all 1000 trees have been made."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,768.0,774.0, Now we can print out the out of bag error rates for different values for Mtri.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,774.0,784.0," The third value corresponding to Mtri equals 3, which is the default in this case, has the lowest out of bag error rate."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,784.0,791.0," So the default value was optimal, but we wouldn't have known that unless we tried other values."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,791.0,796.0," Lastly, we want to use the random forest to draw an Mds plot with samples."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,796.0,800.0, This will show us how they are related to each other.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,800.0,805.0," If you don't know what an Mds plot is, don't freak out, just check out the stack quest on."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,805.0,813.0, We start by using the dist function to make a distance matrix from 1 minus the proximity matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,813.0,818.0, Then we run CMD scale on the distance matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,818.0,823.0, CMD scale stands for classical multi-dimensional scaling.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,823.0,830.0, Then we calculate the percentage of variation in the distance matrix that the X and Y axes account for.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,830.0,835.0," Again, see the other stack quest for details."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,835.0,839.0, Then we format the data for Gg plot.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,839.0,843.0, And then we draw the graph with Gg plot.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,843.0,846.0, Triple BAM.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,847.0,850.0, Unhealthy samples are on the left side.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,850.0,854.0, Healthy samples are on the right side.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,854.0,861.0," I wonder if patient 253 was misdiagnosed, and actually has heart disease."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,861.0,868.0," Note, the X axis accounts for 47% of the variation in the distance matrix."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,868.0,875.0, The Y axis only accounts for 14% of the variation in the distance matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,875.0,880.0, That means that the big differences are along the X axis.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,880.0,887.0," Lastly, if we got a new patient and didn't know if they had heart disease and they clustered down here,"
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,887.0,893.0, we'd be pretty confident that they had heart disease.
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,893.0,897.0," Her A, we've made it to the end of another exciting stack quest."
StatQuest: Random Forests in R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EXPYzbfLCE,6EXPYzbfLCE,897.0,901.0," If you like this stack quest and want to see more of them, please subscribe."
