"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,74.88,77.72, So let's make a random forest.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,77.72,81.6," Step one, create a bootstrap dataset."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,81.6,86.0, Imagine that these four samples are the entire dataset that we are going to build a tree

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,100.16,106.24, The important detail is that we're allowed to pick the same sample more than once.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,106.24,109.75999999999999, This is the first sample that we randomly select.

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,114.08000000000001,119.0, This is the second randomly selected sample from the original dataset.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,119.0,123.04, So it's the second sample in our bootstrap dataset.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,123.04,126.4, Here's the third randomly selected sample.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,126.4,129.76, So here it is in the bootstrap dataset.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,129.76,133.68," Lastly, here's the fourth randomly selected sample."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,137.04,138.84, And here it is.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,138.84,144.12," Bam, we've created a bootstrap dataset."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,175.88000000000002,179.28000000000003, we randomly select two.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,179.28000000000003,188.12," In this case, we randomly selected good blood circulation and blocked arteries as candidates for the root node."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,188.20000000000002,196.08," Just for the sake of the example, assume that good blood circulation did the best job separating the samples."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,196.08,203.56," Since we used good blood circulation, I'm going to gray it out so that we focus on the remaining variables."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,203.56,208.24, Now we need to figure out how to split samples at this node.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,208.24,216.84," Just like for the root, we randomly select two variables as candidates instead of all three remaining columns."
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,216.84,224.24," And we just build the tree as usual, but only considering a random subset of variables at each step."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,237.04,240.76, Here's the tree we just made.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,240.84,244.0," Now, go back to step one and repeat."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,256.64,258.88, But you get the idea.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,258.88,267.64, Using a bootstrap sample and considering only a subset of variables at each step results in a wide variety of trees.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,267.64,274.44, The variety is what makes random forests more effective than individual decision trees.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,274.44,275.68, Sweet.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,275.68,280.2," Now that we've created a random forest, how do we use it?"

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,291.64,296.52, So we take the data and run it down the first tree that we made.
"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,296.64,302.03999999999996," Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo, The first tree says yes."

"StatQuest: Random Forests Part 1 - Building, Using and Evaluating",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,J4Wdy0Wc_xQ,319.96,324.52, And then we repeat for all the trees we made.
