StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,48.72,51.96, We'll start with this one.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,51.96,56.08, So we want to create a random forest from this data.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,102.24,106.52, So no is our initial guess.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,106.56,108.52, This weight is numeric.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,108.52,114.92, Our initial guess will be the median value of the patients that did not have heart disease.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,130.16,136.48, We do this by first determining which samples are similar to the one with missing data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,136.76,140.76, So let's talk about how to determine similarity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,140.76,145.76," Step one, build a random forest."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,171.16,178.08," That means they're similar, at least that cell similarity is defined in random forests."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,178.08,182.8, We keep track of similar samples using a proximity matrix.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,212.12,217.08, like this after running the samples down the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,217.08,228.44, Now we run all of the data down the second tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,228.44,237.04000000000002," Note, samples two, three and four all ended up in the same leaf node."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,249.6,254.56, Samples three and four ended up in the same node together again.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,254.56,258.88, And sample two also ended up in that same node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,258.88,262.88, Now we run all of the data down the third tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,262.88,267.0, And here's the updated proximity matrix.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,267.0,271.96, Only samples three and four ended up in the same leaf node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,271.96,278.68," Ultimately, we run the data down all the trees and the proximity matrix fills in."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,278.68,282.92, Then we divide each proximity value by the total number of trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,282.92,287.2," In this example, assume we had ten trees."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,287.2,294.84, Now we use the proximity values for sample four to make better guesses about the missing data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,294.84,303.56," For blocked arteries, we calculate the weighted frequency of yes and no using proximity values as the weight."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,322.04,329.16, The weight for yes equals the proximity of yes divided by all of the proximity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,329.16,333.56, The proximity for yes is the proximity value for sample two.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,333.56,336.6, The only one with yes.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,336.6,343.8, And we divide that by the sum of the proximity for sample four.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,384.12,388.28, No has a way higher weighted frequency so we'll go with it.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,603.8,608.12, This is when we have missing data in a new sample that we want to categorize.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,609.56,613.16, Imagine we had already built a random forest with existing data

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,631.24,634.36, The first thing we do is create two copies of the data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,635.0,639.48, One that has heart disease and one that doesn't have heart disease.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,648.36,650.28, These are the guesses that we came up with.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,650.8399999999999,655.0, Then we run the two samples down the trees in the forest.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,674.76,679.0, This option wins because it was correctly labeled more than the other option.
