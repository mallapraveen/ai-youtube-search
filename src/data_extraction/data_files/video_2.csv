StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,102.24,106.52, So no is our initial guess.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,106.56,108.52, This weight is numeric.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,108.52,114.92, Our initial guess will be the median value of the patients that did not have heart disease.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,206.76,212.16," Because no other pair of samples ended in the same leaf node, our proximity matrix looks"
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,212.16,217.2, like this after running the samples down the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,217.2,220.44, Now we run all of the data down the second tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,220.84,237.04," No, samples 2, 3 and 4 all ended up in the same leaf node."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,237.04,242.84, This is what the proximity matrix looked like after running the data down the first tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,242.84,249.76," And after the second tree, we add 1 to any pair of samples that ended up in the same leaf node."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,249.76,254.56, And samples 3 and 4 ended up in the same node together again.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,254.56,258.92, And sample 2 also ended up in that same node.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,258.92,262.88, Now we run all of the data down the third tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,262.88,267.08, And here's the updated proximity matrix.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,308.96,315.44, The weighted frequency for yes is the frequency of yes times the weight for yes.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,315.44,322.44, The weight for yes equals the proximity of yes divided by all of the proximity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,322.44,327.44, The proximity for yes is the proximity value for sample 2.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,327.44,330.44, The only one with yes.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,330.44,334.44, And we divide that by the sum of the number of the number of the proximity values.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,334.44,337.44, So the weight for yes is 0.1.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,337.44,343.44," Thus, the weighted frequency for yes is 0.03."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,359.44,364.44," Thus, the weight for no is 0.9."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,364.44,372.44, And we can plug in the values for the proximity of no divided by all proximity.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,372.44,376.44," Thus, the weight for no is 0.9."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,376.44,383.44, And the weighted frequency for no is 0.6.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,383.44,388.44," No has a way higher weighted frequency, so we'll go with it."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,388.44,397.44," In other words, our new improved and revised guests based on the proximity is no for blocked arteries."

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,413.44,420.44, Sorry if there's any confusion between a patient's weight or a sample's weight and the weight used in the weighted average.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,420.44,431.44," To calculate that weight, we start with the proximity for sample 1, divided by the sum of the proximity."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,431.44,436.44, So sample 1's weighted average weight is 0.1.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,527.44,534.44, 1 in the proximity matrix means the samples are as close as close can be.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,534.44,541.44, That means 1 minus the proximity values equals distance.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,542.44,554.44, Closes can be equals no distance between and not close equals far away.

StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,565.44,570.44," I think this is super cool because it means that no matter what the data are, ranks, multiple choice, numeric, etc."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,570.44,577.44," If we can use it to make a tree, we can draw heat map or an MDS plot to show how the samples are related to each other."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,577.44,579.44, This is awesome.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,579.44,581.44," Dremble, bam."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,581.44,583.44, I think this is a very good example of a tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,583.44,586.44, I think this is a very good example of a tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,586.44,588.44, I think this is a very good example of a tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,588.44,591.44, I think this is a very good example of a tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,592.44,594.44," Dremble, bam."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,594.44,597.44," Okay, enough fun stuff."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,597.44,600.44, Let's get back to the missing data problem.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,600.44,603.44," At long last, we'll talk about the second method."
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,603.44,608.44, This is when we have missing data in a new sample that we want to categorize.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,608.44,616.44, Imagine we had already built a random forest with existing data and wanted to classify this new patient.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,616.44,620.44, So we want to know if they have heart disease or not.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,620.44,623.44, But we don't know if they have blocked arteries.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,623.44,630.44, So we need to make a guess about blocked arteries so we can run the patient down all the trees in the forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,630.44,634.44, The first thing we do is create two copies of the data.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,634.44,640.44, One that has heart disease and one that doesn't have heart disease.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,640.44,647.44, Then we use the iterative method we just talked about to make a good guess about the missing values.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,647.44,651.44, These are the guesses that we came up with.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,651.44,655.44, Then we run the two samples down the trees in the forest.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,655.44,662.44, And we see which of the two is correctly labeled by the random forest the most times.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,662.44,668.44, This option was correctly labeled yes in all three trees.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,668.44,674.44, This option was only correctly labeled no in one tree.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,674.44,679.44, This option wins because it was correctly labeled more than the other option.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,679.44,681.44, Bam.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,681.44,686.44, We filled in the missing data and we've classified our sample.
StatQuest: Random Forests Part 2: Missing data and clustering,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ870aTKqiM,sQ870aTKqiM,686.44,690.44," Hey, we've made it to the end of another exciting stat quest."
